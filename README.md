Platform specific software/application have been a major set-back to the integration of heterogenous applications. A mailing list microservices can be used to provide ready-made functionalities to a traditional mailing list application. The data responsible for all processing in the mailing list microservices is managed by the Relational Database Management System. The communication between client and the server is done using gRPC API client and gRPC API Server which allows the client and the server to communicate transparently and develop connected systems. Mailing list can be managed efficiently by transmitting or sending the mail lists in a particular batch format with each batch having limited size to hold the mails in a serial wise order.
